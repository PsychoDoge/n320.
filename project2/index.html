  <p>Halo is a masterpiece of it's time in both gameplay and visual style, it has influenced things up to today. Halo CE had one of the best stories in a first person game of the classic generation.
    Halo is a great game if your looking to get into the start of the sieries, if you cannot find an og xbox, there are plenty of remakes. lastly the master chief collection is on steam and might be worth a look.

    <p>Halo 2 is the Awsome follow up to the hit game Halo CE, and bungie hits it out of the part with even more gameplay, as well as introducing a hijack mechanic. the story hits well and the gameplay is fluid.
    there is one major problem thought the story has a fairly abrupt cut out just as the story felt like it was ramping up, if not for this it would be a 10/10. Other than that it is one of the best fps arena shooters realesed on the xbox. You can get the game on xbox and xbox 360, you can also get it throught the master chief collcction on steam and xbox one.</p>  </div>

    <p>Halo 3 is the final game in the halo triligy, as a game the gameplay has slowed down a bit, but due to the changes in overall gameplay that feels perfect for what it is. it has buetifal graphics, even when you consider todays graphics.
    Halo three finaly puts the curtains on the initial trilogy, the ending is well structured and a perfect way to end the epic that spanes over the three games. As said with the other two you can buy this on the xbox 360 its backwords compatible with the xbox one. you can also buy it on the master chief collection.</p>  </div>

    <p>A flawed game to say the least, they tried to take the sieries in a direction that did not fit the games, this aused the multiplayer to often feel off, with better map design they could have probably pulled it off, another issue with the game is how it betrays the storytelling of the previous games. The story i would say is better than avarage, but it carries some major problems, like the Ai being quite dumb at times. The multiplayer has other problems aswell they went with a loudout based system something not common to halo, it made the arena gameplay feel a little weak, while enjoyable not as much as the others. you can find this game on the xbox 360 backwards compadible with xbox one, and is in the master chief collection. </p>  </div>

  <p>Halo 5 is a mess, not how you want a review to start, but halo 5 has so many issues that it's hard to pinpoint wih hurt it the most, the refocusing to movement causes the maps to be rediculisly open, to the point where it's not that fun to play on some of the maps, they decided to introduce lootboxes in one of the worse ways imaginable, and the only map that feels slightly balanced enough to allow the true fun of this game in all it's glory is warzone. The campaign feels dumb down to the point where it kind of made my brain numb. another problem the story has is the charactors were very subpar, to the point that the only likable ones was chief. If you want to buy this mess it's available on the xbox one</p>    </div>

    <p>Dragon quest 11 is one of my favorite game in the game sieries, it has plent of character in the story, one of my favorite things is that it stays true to the dragon quest formula that has been refined to the highest extent. It has the classic gameplay, which is turn based, they added ultimate moves, and lastly the visuals are very good, when you consider how they have locked to the 3ds for a few gens, The story is fairly straighfoward, but has some nice twist, ill be the first to tell you that i have a large bias in afavor of this game. you can find this game on the xbox one, switch, pc, playstation 4, it will most likely be ported to next gen consoles.  </p>  </div>

  <p>Guild wars one, while the rating is high i cannot recomend this game, not due to quality, but since it's a mmo and the second game came out you hvae to play with a severly minimized cummunity, where mmo's are supposed to be very social, but that being said if you are willing to play solo, than i can say you would most likely like this game if you like mmo's, this game will appeal to you. if you want to play this game you can find a copy on Ebay or any second hand site, mostly due to the fact that the game itself is no longer being printed. </p>    </div>

    <p>Guild wars 2 is far easier to recommend as the population is much higher, and it is still recieving expansions, guild wasrs two is an improvement on guild wars one, a lot of the old and outdated sytems of GW1 were revamped, the game is extremly enjoyable, and has some of the most fun pvp you find in a MMO, the dungeous are okay, i wish they were better though it's only a small problem if a problem at all. the real issue is the story, i find that is very hard to care about, as it has a lot of information overload, if it was a bit more concise i think that it would do the game wonders. lastly if you want to buy this game you can buy it from there site or buy a physicl copy online. </p>  </div>

    <p>Cooking mama, is a great game for a younger audience, the reason that this game is so low on the rating is because being a good kids game does not make is a good overall game, i would absolutly recommend this for younger audiences as it is a fun little game that captures a very happy and nice world. now that i got that out of the way how does this game stand up when we mostly take the targeted audience away, and i find that it is hollow, cooking mama 2 on the same platform felt like more of a game, that is why it is importent, becasue the reason it has a low score is because we are comparing it to the second game. the gameplay is fine, and the "story" is fine, overall it's fine. you can buy it on second hand sites and markets for the ds.  </p>  </div>

    <p>This game is a classic and most worth playing no matter who you are. the game itself defined a generation of platformers, but how does it stand when compared to games of this day and age, and it compares good, this is because games are a interactive medium so the gameplay matters much more than the visuals, but you still need decent visuals. the game has bothe gameplay, and fun and stylized visuals, but there is a caviot "THE CAMARA DUH DUH DUH..." the camara is god awful for this game, now you could forgive the original for this, but if you own the newer remakes it is unexcusable, and while this is not game breaking the lack of control of the camara aused me to die a large amount of times. if you want to buy this game you can one the switch(for a limeted amount of time, boo), the original n64, and lastly ds.  </p>  </div>
